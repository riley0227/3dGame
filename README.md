# Dungeon Doors 3D Game

Authors: Will Blodget, Sam James, Jessica Chammas, Riley Thompson, Jackson Keus, Nathan Maayah

### Aspects:
- Shop for new combat tools
- Go through levels with an increasing # of enemies
- Door to the next room spawns when you kill all the enemies
- Backpack increases inventory space (can purchase unlimited)
- Can buy more heart capacity
- Capped at 10 enemies (10 levels)
- Room 0 - used for testing, can pick up items to test (might delete or turn into spawning room)
- Every 4 rooms you go to the shop between level spawning

### People Split So Far:
- Setup/Room/Levels and character - Sam
- Shop canvas & manager - Jessica
- Inventory/Backpack/player hearts&healing/collectables & extra pizazz - Will
- Punching/player movement/player cam - Nathan
- Enemy spawner/door spawner - Jackson 
- Weapon prefabs/weapon holder - Riley

### Issues Encountered:
- Aspect ratios
- Weapon animations (gif -> sprite sheet)
- Shop button navigation
- Enemies spawning outside of the map

### Working on:
- Will customize rooms/levels later on (if we have time)
- Menu screen (starting room and/or screen)
- Send to a starting room when you die (nothing happens on death at the moment)
- Maybe more items/weapons/enemies??
