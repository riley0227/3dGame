# Dungeon Doors 3D Game

Authors: Will Blodget, Sam James, Jessica Chammas, Riley Thompson, Jackson Keus, Nathan Maayah

### Basic Gameplay:
In this game, you will go through levels of increasing intensity and fight enemies. You can fight with your fists or buy more damage-inducing weapons at the shop. You have to defeat all of the enemies in the room in order to complete the level and a door to the next level will appear that you must go through to move on.

### Aspects:
- Shop for new combat tools
- Go through levels with an increasing # of enemies
- Door to the next room spawns when you kill all the enemies
- Backpack increases inventory space (can purchase unlimited)
- Can buy more heart capacity (or sometimes appear in levels)
- Capped at 10 enemies (10 levels)
- Stamina - you can sprint, but then can get fatigued quicker (top right bar)
- Room 0 - used for testing, can pick up items to test (might delete or turn into spawning room)
- Every 4 rooms you go to the shop between level spawning
- You can hit enemies out of the room (no ceiling) for fun with certain more intense weapons
- Controls page that tells you how to play

### People Split So Far:
- Setup, Room, Levels, character, & lighting - Sam
- Shop canvas & manager - Jessica
- Inventory/Backpack/player hearts&healing/collectables, menu/controls & lots of ideas! - Will
- Punching/player movement/player cam - Nathan
- Enemy spawner/door spawner/death spawner - Jackson 
- Weapon prefabs/weapon holder/sound effects - Riley
- (we did most of this pair-programming style so we were all involved in ideas while one person coded each)

### Issues Encountered:
- Aspect ratios
- Weapon animations (gif -> sprite sheet)
- Shop button navigation
- Enemies spawning outside of the map
- inventory is hard

### Working on:
- Will customize rooms/levels later on (if we have time)
- Menu screen (starting room and/or screen)
- Send to a starting room when you die (nothing happens on death at the moment)
- Maybe more items/weapons/enemies??
- Sound effects
